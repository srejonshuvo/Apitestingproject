# API TESTING README FILE
## Hi welcome to my API testing project.I test some api using postman.

# What is APIs?
### APIs are mechanisms that enable two software components to communicate with each other using a set of definitions and protocols. For example, the weather bureau’s software system contains daily weather data. The weather app on your phone “talks” to this system via APIs and shows you daily weather updates on your phone

# What is API Testing
### API testing is a type of software testing that analyzes an application program interface (API) to verify that it fulfills its expected functionality, security, performance and reliability. The tests are performed either directly on the API or as part of integration testing.
